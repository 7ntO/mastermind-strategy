This document provides a systematic review of the main strategies for playing the Mastermind game. Chapter 1 introduces the game and formalizes basic concepts and properties. Chapter 2 describes various heuristic strategies, detailing their rationale, performance, and limitations. Chapter 3 describes the techniques used to find an optimal strategy; in particular, it formalizes codeword equivalence under different criteria. Chapter 4 provides an overview of randomized strategies aimed at solving large-scale games efficiently. Chapter 5 introduces some variations of the rules and discusses the corresponding strategies. Chapter 6 details a computer program implementation of the strategies discussed above.
