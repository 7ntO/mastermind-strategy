#summary Performance profiling results

= Compiler Benchmarks =

This section compares the run-time performance of executables generated by different compilers. The source code and the program arguments must be the same.

== Test-optimal-p4c10n-r167 ==

Test: Find the optimal strategy for Bulls and Cows using a single thread.

Result: clang outperforms gcc, which in turn outperforms icc, in both CPU and memory.

Source: r167 (Mar 15, 2012)

Command:
<code language="sh">bin/mmstrat -s optimal -r p4c10n</code>

Output:
{{{
